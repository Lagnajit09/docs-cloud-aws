# S3 Storage Classes Comparison

| **Storage Class**                | **Description**                                                                 | **Use Cases**                                                                                     |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **S3 Standard**                  | High durability, availability, and performance for frequently accessed data.    | Frequently accessed data, active content (e.g., websites, mobile apps), big data analytics.      |
| **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**       | Automatically moves data between access tiers based on usage patterns.          | Unknown or changing access patterns, cost optimization without manual intervention.              |
| **S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)** | Low-cost storage for infrequently accessed data with rapid access when needed.  | Disaster recovery, backups, and long-term storage with occasional access.                       |
| **S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)** | Similar to S3 Standard-IA but stored in a single Availability Zone.            | Cost-sensitive infrequently accessed data where regional redundancy is not required.             |
| **S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval** | Archive storage with millisecond access for data that is rarely accessed.       | Data requiring long-term storage but frequent retrieval, such as medical records or archives.    |
| **S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval** | Low-cost archive storage with retrieval times of minutes to hours.              | Long-term data archiving with less frequent retrieval, regulatory archives.                      |
| **S3 Glacier Deep Archive**      | Lowest-cost storage for data that is rarely, if ever, accessed.                 | Regulatory archives, historical records, data retention for compliance with multi-year retention policies. |
| **S3 Outposts**                  | Storage for on-premises data with the same API as in the AWS cloud.             | Data residency requirements, on-premises storage needs with AWS integration.                     |
