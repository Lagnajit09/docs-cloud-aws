# GCP Networking Pricing (Beginner‑Friendly Guide)

This document explains **how networking is priced in Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**. The goal is to help you understand:

- **What is free vs paid**
- **What actually costs money**
- **Why certain network designs are cheaper or more expensive**
- **How to estimate costs conceptually**

> Networking pricing often confuses beginners because many components exist but only **some of them are billable**.

---

## 1. Big Picture: How GCP Charges for Networking

GCP networking pricing is mainly based on:

1. **Data movement (egress)**
2. **Managed networking services**
3. **Reserved public resources**

### Very important rule

> **Inbound traffic is almost always free.** > **Outbound traffic (egress) is what usually costs money.**

---

## 2. What Is Free in GCP Networking

Many beginners assume _everything_ costs money. That is not true.

### Always free components

- VPC networks
- Subnets
- Routes
- Firewall rules
- Internal IP addresses
- Internal traffic **within the same VPC**

> You do **not** pay just for creating a VPC or subnet.

---

## 3. IP Address Pricing

### 3.1 Internal IP Addresses

- **Free**
- No charge for internal IPs
- No charge for private communication inside VPC

---

### 3.2 External IP Addresses

This is one of the first places beginners see charges.

#### Ephemeral External IP

- Free **while attached to a running VM**
- No cost when actively used

#### Static (Reserved) External IP

- **Charged when NOT in use**
- Free while attached to a resource

> GCP charges to prevent people from hoarding public IPs.

---

## 4. Data Transfer Pricing (Most Important Section)

### 4.1 Ingress Traffic (Incoming)

- **Free** in almost all cases
- Includes traffic from:

  - Internet → GCP
  - Other clouds → GCP

---

### 4.2 Egress Traffic (Outgoing)

This is the **primary networking cost driver**.

You pay when data leaves Google’s network.

Common examples:

- VM → Internet
- Load Balancer → Internet
- GCP → On‑premises

---

### 4.3 Internal Traffic Pricing

| Traffic Type                | Cost     |
| --------------------------- | -------- |
| Same VPC, same region       | Free     |
| Same VPC, different regions | Low cost |
| Different VPCs (peering)    | Charged  |

> GCP is cheaper for cross‑region traffic **inside the same VPC** compared to other clouds.

---

## 5. Load Balancer Pricing

Load balancers have **two cost components**:

1. **Forwarding rule / LB usage**
2. **Data processed**

---

### 5.1 External HTTP(S) Load Balancer

Costs include:

- Hourly charge for LB
- Per‑GB data processed

What you get in return:

- Global anycast IP
- DDoS protection
- SSL termination

---

### 5.2 Internal Load Balancer

- Cheaper than external LB
- Charged per hour and per data processed
- No internet egress costs

---

## 6. Cloud NAT Pricing

Cloud NAT pricing has **two parts**:

1. **NAT gateway usage (per hour)**
2. **Data processed through NAT (per GB)**

### Important

- Cloud NAT does **not** charge for idle VMs
- You only pay when traffic flows

---

## 7. Private Google Access Pricing

- **Free**
- No additional cost

However:

- The **service you access** (Cloud Storage, BigQuery, etc.) may have its own pricing

> Private Google Access only affects **network path**, not service pricing.

---

## 8. VPC Peering Pricing

- No hourly charge
- **Data transfer is charged**

Pricing depends on:

- Region to region traffic
- Direction of traffic

---

## 9. VPN Pricing

### Cloud VPN

Charged for:

- VPN tunnel per hour
- Data transfer through tunnel

Used when:

- Connecting on‑premises to GCP

---

## 10. Interconnect Pricing

Interconnect is **enterprise‑grade networking**.

Charged for:

- Physical connection (monthly)
- Data transfer

Much more expensive but:

- Very low latency
- Very high throughput

---

## 11. DNS Pricing (Cloud DNS)

Charged for:

- DNS zones
- Number of queries

Costs are typically **very small** unless traffic is massive.

---

## 12. Firewall and Routes Pricing

- **Completely free**
- No charge per rule
- No charge per evaluation

---

## 13. Common Beginner Pricing Mistakes

- Using external IPs unnecessarily
- Ignoring egress traffic costs
- Forgetting static IP charges when unused
- Overusing cross‑VPC traffic

---

## 14. Simple Mental Model for Pricing

```text
Create network → Free
Move data out → Paid
Use managed gateway → Paid
Stay private → Cheaper
```

---

## 15. Summary

- Most networking objects are free to create
- Data egress is the main cost
- Public exposure usually increases cost
- Smart architecture reduces networking spend
