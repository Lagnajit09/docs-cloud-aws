## Introduction to AWS Storage

Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers multiple storage solutions designed to meet different application needs, each with unique characteristics and use cases. This guide will explore the primary AWS storage services: Amazon S3, Amazon EFS (Elastic File System), and Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store).

### Benefits of Cloud Storage:
1. **Accessibility**: Access data from anywhere with a network connection.
2. **Replication**: Replication between Availability Zones in AWS is automatically turned on.
2. **Scalability**: Easily increase or decrease storage as needed.
3. **High Availability**: Built-in redundancy ensures your data is accessible when needed.
4. **Security**: Data is encrypted at rest and in transit using AES-256 and SSL.
5. **Cost-effectiveness**: Pay for only the storage used; decommission unused storage to reduce costs.

## Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)

### What is Amazon S3?
(Object Storage)
Amazon S3 is a cloud storage service designed for storing and retrieving any type of object or file. It's highly scalable, durable, and can support trillions of files with hundreds of thousands of transactions per second.

### Key Characteristics of S3
- **Storage Buckets**: Containers for organizing files, with subfolders for further structure.
- **Globally Unique Names**: Each bucket must have a unique name
- **Regional Deployment**: Buckets are deployed in specific regions to reduce network latency
- **Versioning and Lifecycle Policies**: Manage file versions and move infrequently accessed data to Glacier.
- **Access Control**: 
  - By default, objects are private
  - Permissions can be configured at object, folder, or bucket level
  - Supports public and private access configurations

### Use Cases for S3
- Storing website content (static and dynamic)
- Hosting media files (images, videos)
- Backing up log files
- Storing office productivity documents
- Serving as a data lake for big data analytics

### S3 Storage Classes

| **Storage Class**                | **Description**                                                                 | **Use Cases**                                                                                     |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **S3 Standard**                  | High durability, availability, and performance for frequently accessed data.    | Frequently accessed data, active content (e.g., websites, mobile apps), big data analytics.      |
| **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**       | Automatically moves data between access tiers based on usage patterns.          | Unknown or changing access patterns, cost optimization without manual intervention.              |
| **S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)** | Low-cost storage for infrequently accessed data with rapid access when needed.  | Disaster recovery, backups, and long-term storage with occasional access.                       |
| **S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)** | Similar to S3 Standard-IA but stored in a single Availability Zone.            | Cost-sensitive infrequently accessed data where regional redundancy is not required.             |
| **S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval** | Archive storage with millisecond access for data that is rarely accessed.       | Data requiring long-term storage but frequent retrieval, such as medical records or archives.    |
| **S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval** | Low-cost archive storage with retrieval times of minutes to hours.              | Long-term data archiving with less frequent retrieval, regulatory archives.                      |
| **S3 Glacier Deep Archive**      | Lowest-cost storage for data that is rarely, if ever, accessed.                 | Regulatory archives, historical records, data retention for compliance with multi-year retention policies. |
| **S3 Outposts**                  | Storage for on-premises data with the same API as in the AWS cloud.             | Data residency requirements, on-premises storage needs with AWS integration.                     |


### Creating and Managing S3 Buckets
1. **Creation Process**:
   - Choose a unique DNS-compliant name
   - Select a region
   - Configure properties (versioning, logging, etc.)
   - Set permissions
   - Upload objects

2. **File Management**:
   - Create folders for organization
   - Set individual file permissions
   - Manage metadata and tags
   - Support for versioning
   - Cross-region replication options

### Website Hosting with S3
S3 can host static websites by:
- Enabling static website hosting
- Configuring bucket policies for public read access
- Setting an index document (e.g., index.htm)

## Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)

### What is Amazon EFS?

- Amazon EFS is a scalable, fully managed file system designed for use with AWS cloud services and on-premises resources.
- We deploy Amazon EFS within a virtual private cloud (VPC). So therefore, it's accessible to the EC2 instances within that same virtual private cloud. To work with EFS, you create a mount target within a VPC.

### Key Characteristics of EFS
- Mountable file system
- Accessible to multiple EC2 instances simultaneously
- Can store petabytes of data
- Scalable up and down based on storage needs
- Uses NFS (Network File System) protocol version 4.1 (it uses TCP port 2049)

### Use Cases for EFS
- User home directories
- Big data storage
- Web content hosting
- Shared file systems across multiple servers

### Deployment Considerations
- Deployed within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
- Requires mount targets with network interfaces
- Supports Linux and Windows with NFS support
- Performance modes:
  - General Purpose (default)
  - Max I/O (for high-performance workloads)

## Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)

### What is Amazon EBS?

Amazon EBS provides block-level storage volumes for EC2 instances, functioning like traditional hard drives in the cloud.
- Disk storage for virtual machinesrunning in the cloud

### EBS Volume Types
1. **Magnetic**:
   - Traditional hard disk storage
   - ~100 IOPS
   - Up to 1 TB size

2. **General Purpose SSD**:
   - Solid-state drive
   - 3-3000 IOPS
   - Balanced performance and cost

3. **Provisioned IOPS SSD**:
   - High-performance SSD
   - 100-20,000 IOPS
   - Ideal for I/O-intensive workloads

4. **Throughput Optimized HDD**:
   - Measured in MB/s (not IOPS)
   - 20-123 MB/s throughput
   - Cost-effective for large, sequential workloads

5. **Cold HDD**:
   - Low-cost storage
   - 6-40 MB/s throughput
   - Infrequent access data

### Key Features
- Long-term data persistence
- Encryption support
- Snapshot capabilities
- Can be attached/detached from EC2 instances
- Size range from 1 to 16,384 GB

### Snapshot Management
- Create point-in-time backups
- Restore volumes from snapshots
- Region-specific
- Can be shared (with limitations)

  - Compatible with existing backup software
  - Virtual tape drives show up as iSCSI devices
- **Archiving Process**:
  - Ejected tapes moved to long-term storage
  - Tape retrieval can take up to 24 hours
  - Requires explicit retrieval setup before accessing archived tapes

### 3. File Gateway 
- Provides SMB or NFS file access to cloud storage.
