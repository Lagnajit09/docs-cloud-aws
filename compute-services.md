## 4. Container Services

### Comprehensive Container Definition
Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient software environments that package an application with its dependencies, configurations, and runtime requirements. They provide consistency across different computing environments.

### AWS Container Ecosystem
- A container is a discrete environment within an operating system or more recently, a serverless architecture where one or more applications can run. It is typically assigned all the resources and dependencies needed to function.
- A container is a modular and portable environment that includesthe application binaries,software dependencies and hardware requirements wrapped up into an independent,self-contained unit.

![VM vs Container](https://github.com/Lagnajit09/docs-cloud-aws/blob/main/assets/vm-vs-container.png?raw=true)
- The container engine runs on top of a host operating system, traditionally. Within the container, you have the binaries and the libraries and one or more applications or microservices. While a Virtual Machine (VM) is a full abstraction of an operating system, a container is a constrained place to run segregated processes while still utilizing the kernel and other capabilities of the base operating system or an infrastructure provided by the cloud provider, for example, the aforementioned AWS Fargate.
- With traditional virtual machines, the Hypervisor or Virtual Machine Manager runs on the operating system. In a containerized environment, the container runtime, for instance, Docker runs on the operating system. Within the container runtime, you have multiple containers, each with their own libraries and applications.

#### Microserices:
microservices are specific service-oriented application component made up of small independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs for notification and process queuing. Microservices, make applications and apps faster to develop and easier to scale by small, self-contained teams of developers. Microservices are about the design of software, whereas containers are about packaging software for deployment.

#### 1. Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)

  * Integrated with AWS ecosystem
  * Advanced scaling capabilities

#### 2. Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
- **Definition**: ECR is a fully managed container registry where you can store, manage,share, and deploy container images.You only pay for the amount of data that you store in your publicor private repositories.
- **Capabilities**:
  * Secure image storage
  * Versioning and lifecycle management
  * Integration with ECS and EKS
  * Public and private repository support

#### 3. Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
- **Definition**: EKS is a fully managed Kubernetes control plane. Kubernetes is a separate service that allows you to orchestrate, your containersand your container clusters. 
Amazon EKS exposes a Kubernetes API endpoint, so that your existing Kubernetes tools can connect directly to EKS managed control plane.
- **Key Benefits**:
  * Simplified Kubernetes cluster management
  * Automatic updates and patches
  * Enhanced security features
  * Seamless AWS service integration

## 5. Serverless Computing
Modern serverless solutions, often leverage modern cloud infrastructures that emulate the network operating system environment without the need for a Windows or a Linux-based server. These are technologies for running code, managing data, and integrating applications, all without managing servers.

### AWS Fargate
AWS Fargate, is a serverless pay-as-you-go compute engine that lets customers construct applications, without servers.
Fargate tasks include, choosing an Open Container Initiative (OCI)-compliant container image, defining memory and compute resources, as well as running the container with serverless compute.

## 7. Load Balancing
Load balancing is a technique for allocating network traffic equally across a pool of resources.
A load balancer is a device that is placed between the client and the server group and functions as a transparent mediator. At AWS, an Application Load Balancer is a public-facing load balancer. A Network Load Balancer, typically load balances between availability zones. And a Gateway Load Balancer, load balances between virtual appliances.These load balancing services ensure that all resource servers are leveraged equally, by providing: scalability, security, and performance.

![AWS Application Load Balancer](https://github.com/Lagnajit09/docs-cloud-aws/blob/main/assets/load-balancer-working.png?raw=true)
#### Working:
- The source traffic can be IPV4 or IPV6. It can come from the public internetor it can be from internal workloads, operating in AWS Regions, Local Zones and AWS Outposts or hybrid cloud.
- The Elastic Application Load Balancer can do user authentication, provide rich metrics and logging. It can redirect to various targets such as an EC2 Auto Scaling group, Lambda functions, Fargate containers in the cloud,EKS, ECS or an IP address.
- It can do content-based routing. It can perform health checks, for example, against the EC2 instances.
- It provides sticky sessions and it supports several load balancing algorithms.
- In addition, the Application Load Balancer generates a flow log,and you can also run other services. 
- For example, Amazon Cognito to do single sign-on as a commercial identity provider or offload TLS with the AWS Certificate Manager or AWS WAF.

### Types of Load Balancers
1. **Application Load Balancer**
   - HTTP/HTTPS traffic
   - Content-based routing
